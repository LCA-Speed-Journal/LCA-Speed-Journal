	<h1>LCA Speed Journal: 2023 Sprinting Data</h1>
	<p>A hub for the Practice Data collected for the 2023 Sprinters, 
		displayed visually through graphs and through bulleted summaries.<br>
		A Training Logbook and a Progress Chart, all in one.</p>
	
	<!-- Subheading -->
	<h2>Team Statistics</h2>
	<p>Four Categories of Practice Progress: <b>Speed Metrics, X-Factor, Meso-Testing, and Lactic</b>. <br>
		Each Practice, we measure one primary metric, depending on the category of the day. <br>
		Speed Days, color-coded blue, are all about acceleration and top-speed. The <b>10m Fly, 30m Block Start, and 40m</b> are used. <br>
		X-Factor, color-coded pink, is all about power and athleticism. <b>Six Bounds, Triple Broad Jumps, and Standing Triple Jumps</b> are measured. <br>
		Meso-Testing, color-coded purple, are metrics we measure at the top of every month. <b>Vertical Jumps and Single-Leg Wall Sits</b> are here. <br>
		Lactic Metrics, color-coded orange, are the speed-endurance Days. Broken 300s, The <b>24/28s Drill, and the 600m 4x4 Predictor</b> are used here.

		<h3>Progress Scatters</h3>
		<p>Data per Practice Metric, ranked by gendered percentile. Each metric has its own tab. <br> 
			Hovering over a data point will give more information. Womens data is in red, Mens in blue. <br>
		The Qualifying Bands, seen in the 10m Fly, correspond to speed benchmarks based on the EMAC Conference history. <br>
			The upper-bound of the band represents a predicted ~8th place finish, while the lower-bound represents a ~3rd place finish. </p>
