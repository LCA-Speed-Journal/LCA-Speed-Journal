		<h3>Season Opener: 2023 LCA Speed Trials!</h3>
		<p>A Recap of the T&F Season Opener: the inaugural Speed Trials had a positive turnout, and some friendly competition
			offered a great introduction to our season. <br>
			New technology was used, some discussion about the format of practices looking at the season ahead,
			and an opportunity to look at where our athletes are beginning their season. <br>
			Measuring Vertical Jumps, 40m Dashes, and a 10m Fly, see below for the resultant data.</p>
