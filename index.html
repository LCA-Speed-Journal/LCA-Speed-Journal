		<h3>Season Opener: 2023 LCA Speed Trials!</h3>
		<p>A Recap of the T&F Season Opener: the inaugural Speed Trials had a positive turnout, and some friendly competition
			offered a great introduction to our season. New technology was used, some discussion about the format of practices
			looking at the season ahead, and an opportunity to look at where our athletes are beginning their season.
			Measuring Vertical Jumps, 40m Dashes, and a 10m Fly, see below for the resultant data.</p>
